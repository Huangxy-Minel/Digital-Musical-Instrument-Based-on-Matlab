# Digital-Musical-Instrument-Based-on-Matlab
Synthesized different instrument sounds (piano, wooden guitar, violin and drum) in the time and frequency domains via analysis over the physical sound mechanism of the instrument, and wrote digital reverbs and equalizers to modify the sound effects.
Used FL Studio to compose digital synthesized sounds into tracks, and adjusted them in real time through Matlab.
